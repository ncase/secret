				It's okay. We all have secrets, and <i>that's</i> no secret.
				In fact, I think having stuff about you that's not completely public to the whole wide world
				is <i>crucial</i> to your well-being.
			</p>

			<p>
				Okay, back to your secret.
				Maybe nobody else knows about it, or maybe only your friends / your family /
				random people on an obscure internet forum know about it.
				Anyway, chances are some people would support you, some would disapprove, and others will be like, meh.
			</p>

			<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:30px">
				<b style="font-weight:400; font-size:25px;">Click a spot to share your secret to everyone within range:</b>
			</div>

			<p>
				Fortunately, you can choose who you tell your secret to!
				Getting support will make you more confident, more self-accepting,
				in whatever dark, horrible secret you're harboring.
				And the more confident you are, the less the hate hurts.
			</p>

			<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:30px">
				<b style="font-weight:400; font-size:25px;">Get your confidence to 100%, by choosing where to share your secret:</b>
				<br>
				(also, what happens when you tell haters your secret at 50%? at 90%? at 100%?)
			</div>

				Yay, you did it! Unless you scrolled past it, then go back and do it, please &amp; thank you.
			</p>

			<p>
				So that's how our secret, personal traits develop - in the beginning, it's fragile,
				but if you share it among a supportive group, shielded from the judgment of others,
				it becomes stronger. And eventually, you can come out, and safely reveal it to the public.
				Coz this is the biggest misconception people have about privacy:
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Privacy isn't just about what you <i>hide</i>.
				Privacy is also about what you <i>show</i>.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				It's about being able to <i>control</i> what you reveal and to whom,
				keeping things within supportive groups and safe spaces,
				that lets us grow into complex, nuanced human beings.
				And thanks to a wonderful thing called The Internet&trade;,
				we can share parts of ourselves even further!
			</p>

			<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:30px">
				<b style="font-weight:400; font-size:25px;">Get your confidence to 100% - this time, word spreads further:</b>
			</div>

			<iframe width="800" height="530" style="margin-top:20px" src="model/model_1.html"></iframe>

			<p>
				Hey, are you scrolling past without finishing it? That's alright, coz this one's impossible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sorry I didn't tell you that upfront,
				but I needed you to feel the frustration and futility of the task,
				because <i>this is the world we're creating</i>.
				A world where we can't have safe spaces to grow.
				A world where everyone wants their
				“content” to get “maximum exposure”, and
				<i>we are each other's content.</i> We are maximally exposed.
			</p>
			<p>
				And there's many ways we're exposed --
				An online culture of public shaming.
				Personal data being sold or surveilled.
				Something you say taken out of context, sensationalized, and made viral for clicks.
				Don't get me wrong, it's awesome that The Internet&trade; can broadcast to a worldwide audience,
				but it shouldn't do that by default for <i>everything</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now, we're like public speakers with permanent clip-on microphones...
				and they don't turn it off when we go to the loo.

				<b>THIS IS A DRAFT.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A polished prototype, a vertical of what the full Explorable will be.
				If you're viewing this page, and you're not me,
				well, I dunno what to tell ya. This page is my secret.
				You're cramping on my secret style, yo.

				<b>Notes to Self:</b>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Why the interactivity matters, and isn't just a gimmick:</b>
						1) By showing privacy as a game mechanic, it shows privacy as a <i>social mechanic</i>,
						and not just a fluffy feeling.
						2) Peeps can learn how to best use privacy to enhance their own personal growth!
						3) It lets peeps see simple rules turn into counterintuitive results,
						like how high sharing can stunt personal growth.
					</li>
					<li>
						That character above is Samantha.
						My plan is to make her the main character of this Explorable Explanation.
						First, it'll show her going through some touching personal growth,
						<i>then I completely destroy that</i>.
						From then on, her story will be <b>a composite of true stories</b> from victims of doxxing, public shaming,
						and brutal internet mobs. Samantha's story ends with her being chased out of her apartment,
						after her address was leaked to a vengeful online mob, angry at something she didn't even do.
					</li>
					<li>
						The “primary audience” would be teens and young adults.
						(also why Samantha is a young 'un)
						Made sense, since this post is about personal growth &amp; social media.
						But I'll make it still accessible and interesting to a wider audience.
					</li>
					<li>
						Actually though, I want this piece to have a powerful emotional core.
						The struggle to be yourself is universal, but something younger folk deal with more.
						I want Samantha's story to show what's really at stake,
						and that privacy isn't just some fluffy abstract concept.
					</li>
					<li>
						In one line: “Samantha's formative years are now her performative years.”
					</li>
					<li>
						I should probably have an at-least-bittersweet ending,
						with Samantha recovering,
						and show the player steps we can take to rebuild a culture that respects privacy.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the full version, there will also be multiple Confidence bars,
						to show how privacy can also lets us grow to be multi-faceted, complex.
						As Walt Whitman once said, "I Contain Multitudes".
						Maybe, without privacy, we would say, "I Constrain Multitudes".
					</li>
					<li>
						Also in the full version, maybe the <i>final playable</i> can allow you to
						control <i>where</i> to share your secret, but <i>also</i> the sharing radius.
						That's far more control, and since privacy = control, that's far more privacy.
						And maybe in this final playable, Samantha gets her happy ending.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Core goal:</b> To get people to understand privacy isn't just a fluffy feeling,
						<i>it's the very damn thing that makes us human</i>. 
					</li>
				</ul>
